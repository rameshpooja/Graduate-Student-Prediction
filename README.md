# Graduate-Student-Prediction

The objective is to develop predictive models using various techniques such as Linear Regression,KNN, Neural Nets, Support Vector Machines, CART, and Gradient Boosting Regressor to estimate the likelihood of a student's admission. These models will be trained to predict the numerical probability of admission based on factors such as a student's grades and test scores.

In this study, the performance of various models will be assessed based on their ability to predict admission probabilities from a student's academic data. To evaluate the accuracy and robustness of these models, standard metrics such as R-Squared score, mean squared error (MSE), root meansquared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Gains chart will be employed.
